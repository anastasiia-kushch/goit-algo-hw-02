"""
This program simulates the operation of a service center by generating and processing requests.

Functions:
1. generate_request(queue, id):
   Generates a new request with a unique ID and adds it to the queue.
   Parameters:
     - queue: a queue object to store requests.
     - id: a unique identifier for the request.

2. process_request(queue):
   Processes a request by removing it from the queue.
   Parameters:
     - queue: a queue object from which requests are processed.
   If the queue is empty, a message is displayed indicating that there are no requests to process.

3. main():
   The main function that continuously generates and processes requests in random order.
   The loop runs until interrupted by the user (KeyboardInterrupt), at which point a termination message is printed.
